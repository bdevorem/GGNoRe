This file contains the guidelines for contributions to our project!
Please see below for more information about our project's goal, the workflow to
contribute to the project, and style guidelines for your contributions!


Mission
=======

The goal of this project is to provide a compiler and tool suite that force
good programming practice in a fun, esoteric setting. We don't take ourselves
too seriously, but we do take our C coding conventions seriously!


Contributions
=============

If you seek to contribute to this project, please keep it in the spirit of
our mission given above. Whether it be bug fixes to existing code or entirely
new features, do your best to ensure that the feature is relevant and follows
the workflow and style guidelines given below!


Contribution Workflow
=====================

For those seeking to contribute to the project, please do as such:

1. If a bug fix, please raise an issue denoting your intent to fix it.

2. Fork the repository.

3. Make your contributions.

4. Submit a pull request explicitly detailing the following:
	- Your contribution
	- Why it should be included
	- The names of all contributors to your patch
	- If it was a bug fix, the relevant issue that was raised.

5. If your patch is accepted, you will be notified!


Contribution Style Guide
========================

For contributions, please follow the following code style guidelines:

- Please utilize Python 2.7 for all contributions. If your contribution
  requires a different language or libraries not currently included in
  requirements.txt, please raise an issue noting the significance and
  your reasoning.

- All patches must work correctly on all Unix-like systems, including MacOS.

- Please do not push changes until being sure that they work on all systems.

- Please keep functions short, sufficient, and following the Rule of 30. Any
  other practice would be hypocritical.

- If your contribution improves one of our existing tools, please add the code
  to said file. Otherwise, please create a new script for your tool.

- All code should be modularized when possible.

- Please avoid bloat in code. We want this to run as efficiently as possible.
